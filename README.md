# Why, hello there

I'm Parker (or David W Parker).

I'm a developer, generally speaking.

I'm a two time Techstars CTO (1x exit).

I'm a fan of [teaching others how to code on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/iamdavidwparker) and even made my [own site](https://www.programmingtil.com/) to put my YouTube videos on. I currently have over 250 FREE published videos. I also maintain a newsletter on [ProgrammingTIL](https://www.programmingtil.com/).

I'm currently [building a product](https://www.useproducer.com/) to help content creators like me streamline the content creation process.

If you like my work, you can feel free to support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/davidwparker) and [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/davidwparker).

Cheers!
